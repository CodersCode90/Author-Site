      <h2>About the Book</h2>
      <p>This book is about Hazel Princeton—the girl who seemed to have it all but was carrying a truth no one saw. Before the world knew she and Anthony “Blu” Rogers were half-siblings, Hazel felt a bond with him she couldn’t explain and never dared to admit. He was her knight, but she stayed silent—afraid of losing him if he didn’t feel the same, and afraid of losing her place in the world she’d worked so hard to claim. Here, Hazel finally shares her side, revealing the heart behind the image and the choices that defined her.</p>

      <h2>Synopsis</h2>
      <p>On the surface, Hazel Princeton has it all—rich, popular, beautiful, the head cheerleader admired by everyone. But Hazel’s life has always been more complicated than appearances suggest.</p>
      <p>She carries a truth that changed everything: Anthony “Blu” Rogers is not just her friend—he is her half-brother.</p>
      <p>Long before that secret was exposed, Hazel felt a closeness to Blu she couldn’t explain, one that went far beyond the roles they played in school. He was her protector, her knight, yet her own silence and fear kept her from speaking the words she longed to say.</p>
      <p>At last, Hazel gives voice to her side of the story. Through her eyes, readers see the hidden battles of a girl who seemed untouchable, and the reasons she chose distance over confession. </p>
      <p>This is Hazel’s perception—tender, conflicted, and true.</p>
