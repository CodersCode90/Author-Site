      <h2>About the Book</h2>
      <p>This book is about Frank Hampton learning the hard truth that revenge doesn’t heal—it chains you down. After losing his brother, Frank dives headfirst into the same violence that took everything from him, only to realize he’s becoming someone he doesn’t want to be. At its core, this is a story about grief, betrayal, and the painful fight to choose a different path before it’s too late.</p>

      <h2>Synopsis</h2>
      <p>Frank Hampton’s world shattered the night his older brother was murdered by the brother of his best friend. In his grief, Frank turned to the streets,</p>
      <p>chasing revenge by joining the same gang life that once claimed Dorian. But vengeance comes with a price, and soon Frank finds himself trapped in a world of violence and betrayal he never truly wanted.</p>
      <p>The cruel irony is that the only person who can help him escape is the same man he swore to kill. Torn between love and hate, loyalty and vengeance, Frank’s anger begins to turn on those closest to him—including the friend who once felt like family.</p>
      <p>As his choices close in, Frank must confront not only the cycle of blood and revenge around him, but the guilt within his own heart. </p>
      <p>To confess the truth of what he’s done—and to decide who he is willing to become.</p>
