      <h2>Synopsis</h2>
      <p>
        Anthony “Blu” Rogers was born into a name that carries blood. Branded as the son of two alleged murderers, he’s spent every day since drowning beneath the weight of a past he didn’t choose. The town whispers his name like a curse. His friends—Frank, Tyler, and Rosetta—once his lifeline, now treat him like something dangerous, something dirty. Even his own reflection feels like a stranger.
      </p>
      <p>
        Abandoned. Neglected. Betrayed. With only the memory of his older brother to cling to, Blu is forced to survive in a world that has already decided who he is. Rumors call him demon spawn. Strangers cross the street to avoid him. And worse—there are people who would rather see him dead than hear him speak.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the middle of it all stands Mr. Cross, a tough but principled cop—and the father of two of Blu’s ex-friends. He takes Blu in, not just out of duty, but something that almost resembles care. Still, the walls in that house echo with tension, and even protection comes with a cost.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then Blu meets Morgan—unflinching, unapologetic, and completely uninterested in what anyone else thinks. She sees Blu clearly, and for the first time in a long time, so does he.
      </p>
      <p>
        But even new beginnings come with shadows. The past doesn’t stay quiet. And as secrets surface, Blu must decide who he wants to be—not just in the eyes of others, but in his own. But Morgan has her own secrets—just like everyone else in Blu’s shattered world. And the closer they grow, the more dangerous the truth becomes.
      </p>
      <p>
        As strange coincidences pile up and the lines between memory and reality start to unravel, Blu must face not just what others believe—but what he believes about himself. And when it all threatens to collapse, he’ll have to make a choice:  
        <strong>Stand and fight—or run.</strong>
