      <h2>About the Book</h2>
      <p>Run Away, Blu! Still Dreaming picks up where the first book left off, diving deeper into the fractured mind and heart of Anthony “Blu” Rogers. After barely surviving the violence of his past, Blu is thrown into a new world—new city, new faces, and the crushing weight of unresolved pain.

This sequel explores the raw reality of PTSD, the complexity of young love, and the blurred lines between what’s real and what we create to survive. With characters both familiar and new, Blu must navigate broken trust, the echoes of abuse, and the confusing emotions that come with trying to heal.

Mysterious figures, emotional reckonings, and a fragile sense of hope push Blu to his limits. This isn’t just a story about trauma—it’s a story about what comes after. About forgiveness. About rebuilding. About learning how to breathe when the wounds never fully close.

Perfect for readers who crave emotional depth, messy healing, and stories that aren’t afraid to explore the shadows before the light.</p>

      <h2>Synopsis</h2>
      <p>Anthony “Blu” Rogers survived the monsters of his past—but peace has a cost.
When his relationship with Rosetta begins to unravel and her new friend Connor turns up dead, Blu finds himself accused of a crime he didn’t commit. Locked away and abandoned, he begins to spiral. His only escape is a window he sketches on the wall—a fragile symbol of hope, sanity, and something better.</p>
      <p>Then comes Sarah. Mysterious. Grounded. Unnervingly familiar. She posts his bail, nudges him toward forgiveness, and guides him back to the family he believes betrayed him. But the closer Blu gets to her, the more uncertain he becomes. Is she even real… or just something his mind created to survive?</p>
      <p>Now in New York under the care of his steady, no-nonsense Aunt Lo, Blu tries to rebuild. He reconnects with people from his past—including Tisha, once a bully, now a bold new light in his life—and finds unexpected strength in a small group of friends who’ve quietly stood by him. Even with old wounds still bleeding and new ones forming, Blu begins to feel something he hasn’t in a long time: possibility.</p>
      <p>But healing doesn’t come without cost. To move forward, Blu must confront his trauma, question what—and who—is real, and face the hardest truth of all:</p>
      <p>Sometimes the person you need to forgive most… is yourself.
